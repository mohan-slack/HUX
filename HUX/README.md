npm install
# For iOS (macOS only)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

---

### 4. **Run the Apps**

#### Backend
```sh
cd HUXbackend
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend (Mobile App)
```sh
cd HUXfrontend
npm start           # Starts Metro bundler
npm run android     # Run on Android device/emulator
npm run ios         # Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
```

## üì± Deploying to Multiple Devices

- **Android:**  
  - Open Android Studio, launch an emulator, or connect a device with USB debugging enabled.
  - Run `npm run android` in `HUXfrontend`.

- **iOS:**  
  - Open Xcode, launch a simulator, or connect a device.
  - Run `npm run ios` in `HUXfrontend`.

- **Expo Go (optional):**  
  - Install Expo Go app on your device.
  - Scan the QR code from `npm start` to run the app instantly (no native build required).
