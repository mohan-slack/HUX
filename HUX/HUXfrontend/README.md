## üì± Native (iOS/Android) Notes

- **Native SDKs:** Place vendor SDKs in `native_sdks/ios/` and `native_sdks/android/`.
- **iOS:**
  - Requires Xcode and CocoaPods
  - Run `cd ios && pod install` after adding native modules
  - Debug native code in Xcode
- **Android:**
  - Requires Android Studio
  - Place .aar files in `native_sdks/android/` and link as needed
  - Debug native code in Android Studio
- **BLE/Device:**
  - BLE integration is scaffolded; see `src/services/BleService.ts` and native_sdks/
  - For vendor SDK integration status, see [../../manufacturer.md](../../manufacturer.md)
